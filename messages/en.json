I aim to continue developing scalable, high-performance systems using .NET, cloud-native architectures, distributed systems, and modern DevOps practices. Becoming highly proficient in designing reliable APIs and robust system infrastructures is a key part of this path.\n\nAt the same time, I am actively expanding my knowledge in artificial intelligence and machine learning. My medium-term goal is to integrate AI-driven approaches into backend development — creating smarter, data-enhanced systems and contributing to products that benefit from automation, prediction, and intelligent decision-making.\n\nIn the long term, I aspire to specialize in industries where technology meets high-impact engineering: aviation, space, and defense. These fields demand precision, reliability, and innovation — values that align closely with my personal motivations and technical interests. My vision is to contribute to mission-critical systems and advanced technological solutions within these sectors, combining backend engineering, AI capabilities, and a strong drive for continuous improvement.",

    "title": "About",
    "narrative": "Growing up with a strong passion for sports, discipline has always been a defining part of my life. As a licensed kickboxer with experience in multiple athletic fields, I learned early on the value of consistency, focus, and resilience — qualities that have shaped both my personal growth and my approach to engineering.\n\nMy interest in technology started at a young age and naturally evolved into a deeper commitment during university, where I immersed myself in software development. What began as curiosity quickly became a long-term pursuit, leading me toward backend engineering and modern web technologies. Over time, I gravitated toward the .NET ecosystem, scalable backend design, and the principles of clean, maintainable code. Working with technologies like ASP.NET Core, React, SQL Server, Redis, and RabbitMQ helped me build a strong engineering foundation centered around problem-solving and system reliability.\n\nAlongside software development, I took my first step into entrepreneurship by founding LLux, an e-commerce business I launched during university. Managing product development, operations, and customer workflows gave me hands-on experience in building small real-world systems — and taught me the practical value of ownership, adaptability, and delivering results.\n\nI also have a long-standing personal interest in financial markets. For over six years, I have been involved in trading and long-term investing as an individual investor. This experience deepened my understanding of market behavior, risk, and strategy, adding another dimension to how I analyze complex problems and make decisions.\n\nMy latest professional step was joining SunExpress Airlines within the Business Airline Solutions team, where I contributed to enterprise-level internal applications. Working in a real corporate engineering environment strengthened my understanding of scalable architecture, Agile practices, CI/CD pipelines, and teamwork in large-scale systems.\n\nToday, I continue to focus on backend engineering with .NET, cloud-based development, and system design — while also expanding my knowledge in AI and machine learning. My goal is to combine these areas into meaningful, high-impact technological work throughout my career.",
